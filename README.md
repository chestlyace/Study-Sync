# Study-Sync
StudySync is a collaborative study platform that connects students with compatible study partners based on courses, availability, learning preferences, and skill levels. Unlike NotebookLM's focus on AI-assisted research, StudySync emphasizes human-to-human collaboration with smart matching algorithms.
